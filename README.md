# Facets

Facets is a project where web clients with similar UIs can all perfrom realtime CRUD functions on a shared, central Supabase database.

There are several different "facets" of the web application to perform the same, basic interactions with the database. Each "facet" utilizes different tools to do so, but should provide the same experience regardless.

## Facets-Next

Facets-Next is built with NextJS (and React), Typescript, Supabase, Prisma, Radix-UI, TailwindCSS, all packaged with NPM.
